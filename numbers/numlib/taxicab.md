# Projectlet: Taxicab Numbers
## Learning Objectives
In this project, we will explore dynamically growing data structures, sorting and tradeoffs between time and space. 
## Problem statement

Another name for Hardy-Ramanujan numbers this projectlet approaches [taxicab numbers](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=taxicab+numbers) simplistically with a bruteforce search approach. We will try to answer these are sparse or there are many.

We will extend the idea into taxicab numbers of a higher order ie to powers > 3 and try to answer similar questions.

These explorations should also lead to an understanding of the time considerations in designing datastructures and algorithms.
